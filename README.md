## 🚀 Featured Project: Multi-Source Excel Extraction Tool
*I built this to automate the tedious process of manual data entry from fragmented business reports.*

### What it does:
* **Recursive Searching:** Scans deep directory trees to find specific `.xlsx` or `.csv` files using `os` and `glob`.
* **Data Consolidation:** Uses `pandas` to merge hundreds of individual reports into a single, cleaned master dataset.
* **Automated Cleaning:** Handles column mismatches and deduplication automatically.
